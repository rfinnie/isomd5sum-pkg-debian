md5.c contains public domain code, originally written by Colin Plumb:

 This code implements the MD5 message-digest algorithm.
 The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.  This code was
 written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.
 This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.

 Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.
 This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,
 except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese
 with every copy.

 To compute the message digest of a chunk of bytes, declare an
 MD5Context structure, pass it to MD5Init, call MD5Update as
 needed on buffers full of bytes, and then call MD5Final, which
 will fill a supplied 16-byte array with the digest.

 Modified 12 June 2003 Jeremy Katz <katzj@redhat.com> to handle
 endianness better
