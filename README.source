Upstream does not reliably publish tarballs of its releases.  However,
it does (currently) reliably tag releases within its Git tree:

Vcs-Browser: http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/isomd5sum.git
Vcs-Git: git://git.fedorahosted.org/isomd5sum.git

Debian orig tarballs are built from these Git tagged releases.
Currently, this means tarballs generated by upstream's cgit software.
